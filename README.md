## About The Project   
A Modern, Cross-Platform School Management System


### 1.1 Project Description 
Our system is a .NET Electron-powered desktop application designed to streamline administrative workflows, enhance academic coordination, and improve communication for Cloud & Code Academy. Built with Vue.js for a responsive frontend and Electron for seamless cross-platform compatibility (Windows, macOS, Linux), it centralises critical operations into one intuitive interface:
 
 * Student Management: Simplified enrolment
 * Academic Tools: Assignment creation
 * Dynamic Scheduling: Timetable generation
 * Real-Time Communication: Announcement broadcasting
 * Course Administration: Effortless course creation, updates, and curriculum adjustments.

By unifying these features, the system reduces manual overhead, minimises errors, and empowers educators to focus on teaching, while ensuring students and administrators stay synchronised.
